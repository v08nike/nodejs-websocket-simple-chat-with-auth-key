# How to Use

You can run the client files from any browser.

Start node.js server and put its path in the client's javascript inside websocket with proper port number.

# Deploy to Heroku

Just change the path of websocket to your herokuapp's path.

For example, if your app is example.herokuapp.com then put wss://example.herokuapp.com/

Do not specify any port in your client javascript.
